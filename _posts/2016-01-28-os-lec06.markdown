## Components of OS
* Process management
	* A process is a program in execution 
		* unit for the OS to associate resources and do scheduling
	* schedules process so as to store the CPUs
	* user processes and system processes
	* services 
		* create process
		* kill process
		* suspend process
		* IPC
		* deadlock detection / avoidance
* Memory management
	* controls primary memory (RAM)
	* services
		* alloc
		* free
		* share
	* secondary mem mngment
		* swap paging space
		* on secondary memory
			* disk drive
			* flash memory
		* reserve primary memory for memory currently in use
* I/O Management
	* controls I/O devices
	* provides low level routines that are device specific
	* deals DMA devices using interrupts
	* provides I/O protection
	* I/O scheduling on shared devices
		* ![](/images/OSLEC06A.png)
	* I/O cacheing
* File Management
	* Logical loger above IO management
	* directories & heirachy
	* permissions
* other subsystems
	* networking
	* accounting - 누가 뭘쓰는지
	* security

	
* Primary way services are invoked is via syscalls
	* API between processes and the OS
	* Every OS needs a well defined syscall API
* Syscall is implemented with trap instruction
	* trap N
* An OS comes with system programs
	* ex) file management
		* cp, rm, ln, ls
	* status info
		* ps, df, date
	* modification program 
		* vi, emacs, gedit
	* program development
		* gcc, ld, gdb
	* user interface
		* CLI:bash, ksh, zsh, csh
		* GUI: gnome

### OS structuring
#### examples
* DOS(MSDOS)
	* ![](/images/OSLEC06B.png)
* UNIX
	* ![](/images/OSLEC06C.png)
	* 모노리띡인데 이건 인터럽 드리븐이라 문제생길수있다
	* deal with interactions b/w components at interrupt time
	* set priority level (SPL) - 인터럽트의 프라이어리티를 설정 (이레벨 밑으론 안걸리게)
		* cause deadlocks 
		* stalls - 인터럽을 오랫동안 없애면 생기는현상
		* hard to change
* Mach
