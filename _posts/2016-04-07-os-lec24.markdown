## Subset prob
![](http://bgshin.github.io/images/OSLEC23A.png)
* FIFO는 S,T가 다를수있다
* Exercise (누가 subset prop성립하는지?)
	* MFU - 
	* LFU

## LRU implementation
* Requires hardware support
	* Timestamp in the page table entry
	* |P|R|M|fram#|timestamp|
	* LRU algorithm would need to examin every PTE to determin the oldest timestamp -> very expansive
* Approx LRU
	* multiple reference bits
	* mark left most bit
	* periodically shift to right (easy)
	* choose the smallest # (easy)

* S/W Approx to LRU
	* uses 1 ref bit
	* second chance replacement (Low/Hi watermark on free list)
	* ![](http://bgshin.github.io/images/OSLEC23B.png)
	* Clock implementation
		* start scan when low watermark reached
		* if the ref bit is on, turn it off
		* If its off then turn the presence bit off and move it to the free pool
		* continue scanning until the high watermark is reached

		
## Support Part B
* new sys call
* SYS11 Virtual V	
* SYS12 Virtual P
	* D4<-VA(in seg2)
	* ![](http://bgshin.github.io/images/OSLEC23C.png)
* SYS14 diskput 
* SYS15 diskget 
	* D3<-VA (seg2일경우 Vsem으로 보호해야함)
	* D4<-Track#
	* D2<-sector#
	* D2-># of bytes trans
	* Use disk daemon to execute a management algorithm
