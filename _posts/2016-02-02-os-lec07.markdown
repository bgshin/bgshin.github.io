## Virtualization
* 	Popular
	* server consolidation
	* run multiple OS types and versions
	* security reasons
	* test new OS's & SW w/o compromising production work
* hyperviser: partitions the hardware and makes each OS think its running directly on the HW
* Type 1 Hypervisor
	* ![](/images/OSLEC07A.png)
	* runs right on the HW
	* Xen,  KVM, Vmware ESX
	* The OS running on top of type 1 can run in two ways
		* fully virtualized
			* client OS is unaltered and unaware of the hypervisor
			* uses trap 
				* 트랩(인터럽트)하면 하이퍼바이저로감, 시물레이션함, 레지스터도 시물레이션함
				* simulates polk activity
				* windows client runs this way
			* 단점: 트랩하고 시물하면 느리다, some efficiency lost
		* paravirtualized
			* hypervisor has an API
			* Guest OS uses this API
			* open system OS's have this API
			* 훨씬 효율적임
* Type 2 Hypervisor
	* ![](/images/OSLEC07B.png)
	* virtualBox, parallels, vmware

	
### Java
* Add another layer of portability
* Java VM simulates a fictional CPU
	* instruction set - BYTE CODES
	* JavaVM is a native application
* Java compiler compiles to byte codes
* runs in Interpreter speeds
* Secure since 
	* cryptographic security
	* runs in a sand box
