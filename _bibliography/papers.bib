  Abstract = {Artificial neural network-based analysis has recently been used to predict clinical outcomes in patients with solid cancers, including lung cancer. However, the majority of algorithms were not originally developed to identify genes associated with patients' prognoses. To address this issue, we developed a novel prognosis-related feature selection framework called Cascaded Wx (CWx). The CWx framework ranks features according to the survival of a given cohort, by training neural networks with three different high- and low-risk groups in a cascaded fashion. We showed that this approach accurately identified features which best identify the patients' prognoses, as compared to other feature selection algorithms, including the cox proportional hazard and Coxnet models, when applied to the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) transcriptome data. The prognostic potential of the top 100 genes identified by CWx outperformed or was comparable to those identified by the other methods as assessed by concordance index (c-index). In addition, the top 100 genes identified by CWx were found to be associated with the Wnt signaling pathway, providing biologically relevant evidence for the value of these genes in predicting the prognosis of patients with LUAD. Further analyses of other cancer types showed that the genes identified by CWx had the highest prognostic values according to c-index. Collectively, the CWx framework will potentially be of great use to prognosis-related biomarker discoveries in a variety of diseases.},

  Abstract = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS), which allows the simultaneous sequencing of billions of DNA fragments simultaneously, has revolutionized how we study genomics and molecular biology by generating genome-wide molecular maps of molecules of interest. However, the amount of information produced by NGS has made it difficult for researchers to choose the optimal set of genes. We have sought to resolve this issue by developing a neural network-based feature (gene) selection algorithm called Wx. The Wx algorithm ranks genes based on the discriminative index (DI) score that represents the classification power for distinguishing given groups. With a gene list ranked by DI score, researchers can institutively select the optimal set of genes from the highest-ranking ones. We applied the Wx algorithm to a TCGA pan-cancer gene-expression cohort to identify an optimal set of gene-expression biomarker candidates that can distinguish cancer samples from normal samples for 12 different types of cancer. The 14 gene-expression biomarker candidates identified by Wx were comparable to or outperformed previously reported universal gene expression biomarkers, highlighting the usefulness of the Wx algorithm for next-generation sequencing data. Thus, we anticipate that the Wx algorithm can complement current state-of-the-art analytical applications for the identification of biomarker candidates as an alternative method. The stand-alone and web versions of the Wx algorithm are available at https://github.com/deargen/DearWXpub and https://wx.deargendev.me/, respectively.},

  Abstract = {Predicting drug-target interactions (DTI) is an essential part of the drug discovery process, which is an expensive process in terms of time and cost. Therefore, reducing DTI cost could lead to reduced healthcare costs for a patient. In addition, a precisely learned molecule representation in a DTI model could contribute to developing personalized medicine, which will help many patient cohorts. In this paper, we propose a new molecule representation based on the self-attention mechanism, and a new DTI model using our molecule representation. The experiments show that our DTI model outperforms the state of the art by up to 4.9%p in terms of area under the precision-recall curve. Moreover, a study using the DrugBank database proves that our model effectively lists all known drugs targeting a specific cancer biomarker in the top-30 candidate list.},

  Abstract = {Recent advances in deep learning have facilitated the demand of neural models for real applications. In practice, these applications often need to be deployed with limited resources while keeping high accuracy. This paper touches the core of neural models in NLP, word embeddings, and presents a new embedding distillation framework that remarkably reduces the dimension of word embeddings without compromising accuracy. A novel distillation ensemble approach is also proposed that trains a high-efficient student model using multiple teacher models. In our approach, the teacher models play roles only during training such that the student model operates on its own without getting supports from the teacher models during decoding, which makes it eighty times faster and lighter than other typical ensemble methods. All models are evaluated on seven document classification datasets and show significant advantage over the teacher models for most cases. Our analysis depicts insightful transformation of word embeddings from distillation and suggests a future direction to ensemble approaches using neural models.},

  Abstract = {Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have been heavily used to predict various downstream clinical tasks such as readmission or mortality. One of the modalities in EHRs, clinical notes, has not been fully explored for these tasks due to its unstructured and inexplicable nature. Although recent advances in deep learning (DL) enables models to extract interpretable features from unstructured data, they often require a large amount of training data. However, many tasks in medical domains inherently consist of small sample data with lengthy documents; for a kidney transplant as an example, data from only a few thousand of patients are available and each patient's document consists of a couple of millions of words in major hospitals. Thus, complex DL methods cannot be applied to these kind of domains. In this paper, we present a comprehensive ensemble model using vector space modeling and topic modeling. Our proposed model is evaluated on the readmission task of kidney transplant patients, and improves 0.0211 in terms of c-statistics from the previous state- of-the-art approach using structured data, while typical DL methods fails to beat this approach. The proposed architecture provides the interpretable score for each feature from both modalities, structured and unstructured data, which is shown to be meaningful through a physician's evaluation.},

  Abstract = {With the advent of word embeddings, lex- icons are no longer fully utilized for sentiment analysis although they still provide important features in the traditional setting. This paper introduces a novel approach to sentiment analysis that integrates lexicon embeddings and an attention mechanism into Convolutional Neural Networks. Our approach performs separate convolutions for word and lexicon embeddings and provides a global view of the document using attention. Our models are experimented on both the SemEval'16 Task 4 dataset and the Stanford Sentiment Treebank, and show comparative or better results against the existing state-of-the-art systems. Our analysis shows that lexicon embeddings allow to build high-performing models with much smaller word embeddings, and the attention mechanism effectively dims out noisy words for sentiment analysis.},

  Abstract = {The electronic health record (EHR) contains a large amount of multi-dimensional and unstructured clinical data of significant operational and research value. Distinguished from previous studies, our approach embraces a double-annotated dataset and strays away from obscure ``black-box'' models to comprehensive deep learning models. In this paper, we present a novel neural attention mechanism that not only classifies clinically important findings. Specifically, convolutional neural networks (CNN) with attention analysis are used to classify radiology head computed tomography reports based on five categories that radiologists would account for in assessing acute and communicable findings in daily practice. The experiments show that our CNN attention models outperform non-neural models, especially when trained on a larger dataset. Our attention analysis demonstrates the intuition behind the classifier's decision by generating a heatmap that highlights attended terms used by the CNN model; this is valuable when potential downstream medical decisions are to be performed by human experts or the classifier information is to be used in cohort construction such as for epidemiological studies.},
